									<h2>Where to? A History of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="www.computerhistory.org/atchm/where-to-a-history-of-autonomous-vehicles/">www.computerhistory.org/atchm/where-to-a-history-of-autonomous-vehicles/</a></p>
                                    
									<p>This source will be useful for gaining insight on the development of autonomous vehicles and will therefore be useful for creating a background section in our project. Furthermore, learning the history behind autonomous vehicles may point to reasons for why autonomous systems have been used for planes and torpedos for a century, and yet still aren’t used in cars today.</p>

									<h2>The Big Problem With Self-Driving Cars is People</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/the-big-problem-with-selfdriving-car-is-people">spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/the-big-problem-with-selfdriving-car-is-people/</a></p>
                                    
									<p>Our second source dives into the different gray areas where human drivers are forced to make difficult decisions. For example, if a pedestrian starts to walk in front of an autonomous car while the car is in a no passing zone, should the car follow the pedestrian slowly to avoid all risk, or attempt to pass the pedestrian blocking the road? Furthermore, it discusses issues where humans may abuse self driving cars by having them drive around in traffic instead of having to pay for parking while they pick up coffee from Starbucks. This is a perspective we hadn’t addressed in our abstract, but it will be a big section of our project.</p>

									<h2>Cars Suck Up Data About You. Where Does It All Go?</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/automobiles/wheels/car-data-tracking.html">www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/automobiles/wheels/car-data-tracking.html</a></p>
                                    
									<p>The third source from a New York Times article discusses the ethical issue of privacy with self driving cars. Self driving cars will log more data than their human driven counterparts, and must do so to develop their machine learning. This will lead to automakers having huge amounts of data on their customers, which is an obvious privacy concern.</p>

									<h2>The Ethical Dilemmas of Self-Driving Cars</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/</a></p>
                                    
									<p>The fourth source from a Globe and Mail article discusses the “modern” variation of the “trolley problem”. Whom should the vehicle save - and who should i tharm - when an accident is avoidable? It also discusses guidelines others have tried setting, such as minimizing human death and not discriminating individuals by age, gender, or any other factor. The “trolley problem” will be a large part of our discussion on the ethics of self-driving cars.</p>

									<h2>Autonomous Driving: Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-662-48847-8_4.pdf">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-662-48847-8_4.pdf</a></p>
                                    
									<p>The fifth source is the chapter <i>Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars</i> from the book <i>Autonomous Driving</i>. If motor vehicles are to be truly autonomous and able to operate independently and responsibly on the road, they’ll need to replicate - or do better than - the human decision-making process. However, some of these decisions require a sense of ethics that computer algorithms find difficulty in processing. This source will greatly contribute to our project because it discusses many topics on the ethics of self-driving cars and why they’re important to discuss, such as crash-optimization and self-sacrifice.</p>

									<h2>Autonomous Vehicles Need Experimental Ethics: Are we ready for utilitarian cars?</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13d4/56d4c53d7b03b90ba59845a8f61b23b9f6e8.pdf">http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13d4/56d4c53d7b03b90ba59845a8f61b23b9f6e8.pdf</a></p>
                                    
									<p>The sixth source is a paper, consisting of many studies, on the utilitarianism of autonomous cars. It provides insight on the perceived morality of self-sacrifice, the willingness to see self-sacrifice being legally enforced, the expectation that autonomous vehicles will be programmed to self-sacrifice, and the willingness to buy self-sacrificing autonomous vehicles. Although we already have insight on the “trolley problem” of self-driving cars, it’s a large portion of the ethics behind self-driving cars, and this paper will provide many studies to support different claims behind the issue. It also talks much about utilitarianism, a doctrine we have talked much about in class.</p>

									<h2>A Survey of Pulbic Opinion About Autonomous and Self-Driving Vehicles in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108384/103024.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/108384/103024.pdf</a></p>
                                    
									<p>This source is an aggregation of survey results from over 1,500 respondents concerning public opinion of self-driving cars in several countries. This will be useful to have for the statistics it contains, since public opinion is an excellent predictor of adoption, as well as providing insight into the key concerns that many people have about autonomous cars.</p>

									<h2>A Philosophy for Developing Trust in Self-driving Cars</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/pubs/wagner15_philosphy_self_driving_cars.pdf">https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/pubs/wagner15_philosphy_self_driving_cars.pdf</a></p>
                                    
									<p>This source is an essay discussing possible methods for improving public trust in self-driving cars via performance enhancements. The essay argues that traditional software-safety techniques cannot hope to mitigate all of the risks that a self-driving car will face, and therefore a new safety philosophy derived from the principle of falsification used in scientific theory vetting. Although some of the specific recommendations made in the essay are too highly specific, it also provides an excellent discussion of the different risks extant between human and computer drivers, and of how people perceive those risks.</p>

									<p>This article is a discussion of how legal liability might work regarding self-driving vehicles. Other sources we have had thus far have contained excellent ethical examinations of self-driving cars, and a source with a more legal perspective will be highly relevant to our topic.</p>

									<h2>Our Bodies in the Trolley’s Path, or Why Self-Driving Cars Must *Not* Be Programmed to Kill.</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0162243917718942">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0162243917718942</a></p>
                                    
									<p>This articles explores the trolley problem primarily through a utilitarian point of view, trying to uncover the best solution for self-driving cars when facing situations of live or death. One interesting question he poses is if principles upheld in experimental ethics should be sufficient to resolve the same situations faced in real life? He notes the vast amount of variables that exist in real life that clutter the black and white decision posed by the trolley problem. Things like the age of the people, time to react, can the trolley really not stop, is the understanding of the situation correct, and many more. These choices are uncertain, organic, and the intricacies of this problem are more than just kill five men or kill one.</p>

									<h2>The Ethics of Accident-Algorithms for Self-Driving Cars: An Applied Trolley Problem?</h2>
                                    
                                    <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10677-016-9745-2.pdf">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10677-016-9745-2.pdf</a></p>
                                    
									<p>This journal article dives into the ethical issues of how automated cars should handle potential accidents. It discusses how the analogy between the trolley problem and the problem with accident-algorithms that are necessary in self-driving cars. It draws notable differences between the circumstances of the two problems. Most notably that the trolley problem the self-driving car faces is not faced by a single individual making a split second decision, this decision, instead, is made by a group of individuals making decisions in code prior to the event. They also note that moral and legal responsibility should be taken into account for self-driving cars, however, this is often not the case in the trolley problem.</p>
