							<h1>Legal Concerns</h1>
						</header>

						<p>A policy vacuum will be created once self-driving cars hits major consumer markets. There is much talk as to what these policies should consist of including aspects such as privacy, driver-safety, freedom, and control. There is an overall agreement that self-driving vehicles should be legal to operate in the United States, but resolving public concerns and creating reasonable policies is a prevalent challenge. There is no emerging all-encompassing solution as of right now, but there are many great ideas that may turn out to be the laws of the future for self-driving cars.</p>
						
						<p>California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada have already passed laws that permit self-driving, autonomous vehicles to be tested on public roads. These cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about driving. We may be given the choice to sacrifice the joy of controlling our own powerful cars in favor of the convenience and potential safety of self-driving cars. To resolve this issue in part, Nevada and California require self-driving cars to relinquish control of the vehicle to the user whenever requested. This would allow the user to pick and choose when they want to use the self-driving abilities of their car. In this case, users would still have control over their car when desired, but would be able to reap the benefits of self-driving when wanted.</p>
						
						<p>Privacy poses more legal issues with no obvious solutions. California demands that the manufacturers of self-driving vehicles provide the customer with full disclosure regarding the information being collected. Whether or not this resolves privacy issues with the user is yet to be seen, but this may be a great start to minimizing concerns about what these large companies may be collecting.</p>
						
						<p>Users are primarily concerned that self-driving cars will track their location and patterns of driving. This is incredibly hard to avoid for manufacturers, as sensors and GPS systems are vital to the car functioning. Policies cannot be enacted to disable these sensors as it would literally disable the functionality of the cars. Therefore, forcing car manufactures to collect the least amount of data necessary may be the best policy option. This would limit the amount of privacy the user has to give up, but still allow self-driving cars to work as intended.</p>

						<h2>Liability</h2>

						</span>
						<p>There are many concerns regarding who is to blame when accidents happen with self-driving cars. As [Minnesota source pg 759] states “Liability rules applying to [self-driving cars] will need to define roles, determine fault, and fix compensation for harm”. Many of these legal questions will be resolved by the level of automation in question.</p>
						
						<p>For example, if the driver has control over the vehicle and allows the crash to happen, then it is likely that the driver would be more liable for damages. However, what happens when the car has autopilot capabilities, but the driver can override them at any time. Is the user responsible for being completely aware when the car is in autopilot? If the driver engages autopilot then is that responsibility transferred to the manufacturer? Much of this issue is resolved through full transparency on purchase of the vehicle. Tesla currently has cars with this feature, but they make it very clear that they will not take responsibility for accidents when the car is in autopilot. They want the user to be aware of the vehicle at all times to ensure an accident doesn’t happen.</p>
						
						<p>On the other hand, if the car is completely autonomous and does not allow the user to take control, then putting the blame on the user seems largely unfair. If the car is controlled through software by the car manufacturer, then if the software fails would the liability fall on the manufacturer? They developed the software, it would make sense to put the blame on them. This seems straightforward, but the circumstances of the crash will absolutely still be necessary to form a valid conclusion on any legal case. Were the conditions suitable for the car? How complex of a situation was it? Did the driver have a chance to override the auto-driving system? Was the car up-to-date on software? There are loads of factors to account for and ultimately having an end-all conclusion is near impossible. Car sensors or recordings will be incredibly helpful when determining fault of an accident. Then the courts will ultimately decide who should be blamed.</p>

						<h2>Privacy</h2>
						<span class="image right">
							<img src="images/PrivacyCar2.jpg" alt="" />
						</span>
						<p>With the prevalence of self-driving cars comes the prevalence of privacy loss. If cars are collecting location data to perform actions, this means that they are collecting your location data and patterns as well. One famous case in this topic is the 1983 <i>United States v. Knotts</i> which concluded that those traveling on public roads do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their movement. It is not clear whether this is still applicable today, as self-driving cars have way more power of data collection that what was available in 1983. Lawmakers will have to consider both sides of the coin in this case. We want to protect the user as much as possible, but limiting the capacity of self-driving vehicles is an important drawback to take into account. A possible solution in the meantime would to force manufacturers to implement an opt-in mechanism to allow consumers to have more control over what data is being gathered on them.</p>
