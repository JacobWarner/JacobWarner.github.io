										<h1>Data Collection</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Self-driving cars need to track information in order to learn and train their algorithms, or even to drive. Persistent GPS tracking is a necessity, and sensors will always be running, attempting to sense all possibilities of driving situations. Therefore, owners of self-driving cars will be forced to give up privacy when they purchase any autonomous vehicle. This will lead to automakers owning a huge data pile. The questions are: what will they do with it, who can use it, and what information can be collected?</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How Self-Driving Cars Could Ruin Privacy</h2>
                                    
									<p>There are government rules that limit how information from black boxes in cars can be used, but there are no rules in the U.S. covering the data captured by other devices in a car. Therefore, any information captured by the technology in new cars, such as the weight of the passengers, whether or not both hands are on the steering wheel, where the driver’s eyes are looking, and even recorded phone calls are fair game for data collection.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Fortunately, there are instances of the government taking action against automakers for invading privacy. General Motors learned this in 2011 when it shared information from OnStar calls with other companies. This led to many complaints and a 2012 Supreme Court decision citing about warrantless tracking of information. Therefore, many automakers are cautious with what they do with their data because they want to keep strong customer relationships. Unfortunately, as more self-driving cars hit the road, more people will be willing to compromise their privacy to obtain one, leading to an overall desensitization towards the loss in privacy for drivers.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>There are interesting concerns arising around what car companies will do with their collected data. They could, for instance sell the data to other companies looking for the most populated routes in different cities so they could place their stores there. Insurance companies would love to purchase the collected information to use in their evaluations for insurance rates. Some even worry that advertisers will pay automakers to make self-driving cars go out of their way to  pass by their stores or tell an owner in the car what stores are on his or her route, with the hopes of convincing the owners to make a pitstop. Another wild possibility would be tracking locations a user visits frequently and using it in dating apps to establish the user’s habits.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>There are also a few benefits to sharing the data. There are great new apps for recording braking, acceleration, speed, and other things to provide car diagnostics, or even lower insurance rates for the safer self-driving cars. Traffic applications like Waze could use the data to update their routing algorithms to account for traffic in real time.</p>

									<h2>Ethical Perspectives</h2>
                                    
									<p>Deontologically, it could be viewed as wrong for automakers to collect data on their customers with self-driving cars, since privacy is an American staple. On the other hand, as times are changing, consumers are caring less about whether their data is in someone else’s hands, and are more concerned with convenience. So from this perspective, it could be deontologically correct, as it will improve the convenience which self-driving cars can provide. From a utilitarian perspective, data collection can be viewed as positive, since consumers will benefit from better self-driving algorithms, and therefore experience less accidents. </p>
