										<h1>Trolley Problem</h1>
									</header>

									<p>What is the <i>trolley problem</i>? The dilemma involves a train that’s about to kill five people tied on the tracks. A bystander is watching this occur and finds themself standing next to a lever. If they pull the lever, they can move the train to another set of tracks, thereby saving the five individuals tied on the other track. Unfortunately, there is one person tied on the second track who would then be killed. What is the right decision?</p>
									<p>The “correct” decision is a heavily debated topic in ethics. A consequentialist might justify switching the tracks to save five people, even at the expense of one. But a non-consequentialist might object switching tracks because the act would be an act of killing (the one person), while doing nothing would merely be allowing someone to die (the five others). In other words, it’d be morally and legally worse to kill than to let die.</p>

									<h2>Modern-Day Trolley Problem</h2>
                                    
									<p>Now we’ll adapt the trolley problem to the technology at hand - autonomous cars. Let’s say an autonomous car is driving along when it gets caught in a similar situation - staying in its lane will cause the death of five pedestrians, while swerving around them will cause the death of a single pedestrian. As with the classical trolley problem, either choice seems defensible. It’s not ridiculous to think that the car should be programmed to act and save lives, even at the expense of a fewer number of lives. Although, in the eyes of the law, it also seems reasonable to think that killing is worse than letting die. Who should the car harm if it finds itself in one of these unavoidable situations? Do children, elderly people, or other factors change the equation?</p>
                                    
									<p>In 2017, Germany became the first country to attempt to answer such morbid questions with actual guidelines, stating that autonomous cars should always attempt to minimize human death and shouldn't discriminate between individuals based on age, gender or any other factor. Furthermore, human lives should also always be given priority over animals or property.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>More than 75 percent of participants support such a utilitarian approach, according to a 2016 study published in Science. That is, unless they happen to be in such a car, in which case the majority would want it to protect passengers – and themselves – no matter the costs. This suggests the issue isn't solely about ethics, but rather it's also about control. People think ethically in principle, but in practice they behave more selfishly, especially if they are not in command of a situation.</p>

									<h2>A Scenario</h2>
									<p>The complexity of this “modern day” trolley problem is far beyond that of the classical problem. Many factors, other than the number of people involved, play a role in its complexity. Imagine your autonomous car encounters this terrible situation: it must either swerve right and strike/kill an eight-year old girl or swerve left and strike/kill an 80-year old grandmother. If it doesn’t swerve, both victims will be killed. What is the ethically correct decision?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>In some eyes, striking the grandmother could be the lesser evil. After all, the girl still has her entire life in front of her. Some may even argue that the little girl and her morality has yet to be tainted, given her age and experiences, so she may better deserve life than the grandmother. On the other hand, we might agree that the grandmother has a right to life and as valuable a life as the little girl’s. According to Germany’s guidelines, either choice is unethical. Treating individuals differently due to some factor, such as age, is exactly the discrimination they prohibit.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>If prejudice isn’t allowed, what should the car do? Another solution could be to arbitrarily and unpredictably choose a path, without prejudice to either person. But this too seems ethically troubling, in that we are choosing between lives without any deliberation at all—to leave it to chance, when there are potentially some reasons to prefer one over the other, as distasteful and uncomfortable as those reasons may be.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>What may be those other distasteful and uncomfortable reasons? Say your autonomous car was programmed to protect its own occupants over those outside the car. It’d make sense for it to choose a collision with the lightest object possible (the girl, in this case). If the choice were between two vehicles, such as a motorcycle and an SUV, then the car should be programmed to strike the motorcycle, right?</p>
                                    
                                    <p>What if the car had to choose between two motorcyclists – one wearing a helmet and the other not. The one wearing a helmet would have a better chance to survive the crash, so the car would probably choose them. But, then they’re essentially being penalized and discriminated against for their responsible decision to wear a helmet, which may encourage others not to wear helmets. Some may also argue that the motorcyclist without the helmet is being reckless and deserves to be harmed over the other. In a similar scenario, what if the car had to choose between two cars based on their crash-safety ratings? Is it a <i>fair</i> choice to target the vehicle with the higher safety rating?</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Programmers in such scenarios, as rare as they may be, would need to design algorithms that assign and calculate the expected costs of various possible options, selecting the one with the lowest costs. The algorithm would potentially determine who gets to live and who gets to die. As with the trolley problem, this is fundamentally an ethics issue. It demands much more care and transparency in reasoning than seems currently offered.</p>
